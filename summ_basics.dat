<!-- This file contains the definition of the "Basics" summary panel. This panel
      contains the list of attributes and derived traits for the character.

      Since all of the tables shown within this summary panel should fit within the
      available vertical space, no scroll is required, so we turn off the scroll
      for each table so that Hero Lab doesn't leave space for one.

      All public visual elements used with summary panels start with the prefix "sm"
      to associate them with the various summary panels.

  <!-- smBasics panel
        This panel is designated as a summary panel and given an order that positions
        it properly amongst the other defined summary panels. We setup a small margin
        to indent the layout from the edges of the panel.

        The panel is assigned a "live" tagexpr so that its visibility can be
        controlled for different types of characters. While not really useful in the
        sample data files, this approach can be quite useful when the data files
        expand to govern creation of widely varying characters, such as vampires vs.
        ghosts vs. mortals in the World of Darkness game system.
